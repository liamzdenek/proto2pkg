## NodeServer


(Relevant documentation for nice-grpc)[https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc/tree/master/packages/nice-grpc]. Note that
we are using ts-proto, not google-protobuf.

This library is distributed in both JS and TS, so all code samples should work with plain JS with the types stripped.

### Server stub implementation

```ts
import {ServiceImplementation} from 'nice-grpc';
import {
    BankServiceDefinition,
    GetBalanceRequest,
    GetBalanceResponse
} from "bank-service-node-server/main";
import {
    DeepPartial,
} from 'bank-service-node-server/main';

const BankServiceImpl: ServiceImplementation<
    typeof BankServiceDefinition
> = {
    async GetBalance(
        request: GetBalanceRequest,
    ): Promise<DeepPartial<GetBalanceRequest>> {
        // ... method logic
        const response = {
            "accountId": "" /* string */,
            "balance": 0 /* sint64 */,
        }
        return response;
    },

};



const server = createServer()/*.useMiddleware(middleware)*/;

// you may implement multiple services within the same process/port, depending on your application architecture
server.add(BankServiceDefinition, BankServiceImpl);

await server.listen('0.0.0.0:8080');

process.on('SIGINT', async () => {
    await server.shutdown();
    process.exit();
});

```

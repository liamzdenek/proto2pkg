## NodeClient


[Relevant documentation for nice-grpc](https://github.com/deeplay-io/nice-grpc/tree/master/packages/nice-grpc). Note that
we are using ts-proto, not google-protobuf.

This library is distributed in both JS and TS, so the below code sample should work with plain JS with the types stripped.

For each `service` definition in your proto files, there will be a corresponding `[ServiceName]Definition` object
within the compiled code. If you have a protoc definition like this, the below typescript is a valid client implementation.
```proto
service ExampleService {
    rpc exampleUnaryMethod(ExampleRequest) returns (ExampleResponse) {}
}
```
```ts
import {createChannel, createClient, Client} from 'nice-grpc';
import {ExampleServiceDefinition} from './main';

const channel = createChannel('localhost:8080');

const client: Client<typeof ExampleServiceDefinition> = createClient(
    ExampleServiceDefinition,
    channel,
);

const response = await client.exampleUnaryMethod({ /* request type fields */ })
```
